### Project Plan for "Pixel Oracle" Web App

#### **1. Project Overview**
The "Pixel Oracle" web app will allow users to input a question, select a category, and receive a random, category-specific response. The design will feature a pixel font and a grey background, with a focus on simplicity and responsiveness.

---

#### **2. Main Tasks**
1. **Project Setup**  
   - Initialize a new web project using a framework/library (e.g., React, Vue.js, or plain HTML/CSS/JS).  
   - Set up version control (e.g., Git).  
   - Create folder structure for components, styles, and assets.  

2. **UI Design**  
   - Design the layout with the following components:  
     - Title: "Pixel Oracle"  
     - Input Box: Text area for the user's question.  
     - Dropdown: List of categories (Romance, Wealth, Career, etc.).  
     - Submit Button: To trigger the response generation.  
     - Response Display Area: Where the random response will appear.  
   - Implement styling:  
     - Use a **pixel font** (e.g., "Press Start 2P" from Google Fonts).  
     - Set the background color to **grey**.  
     - Ensure the design is clean and intuitive.  

3. **Category Data Setup**  
   - Create a JSON file or data structure to store random responses for each category.  
   - Populate responses with entertaining, insightful, or humorous content.  

4. **Functionality Development**  
   - Logic for input handling: Capture the user's question (though it won’t be used for response generation).  
   - Logic for category selection: Capture the selected category from the dropdown.  
   - Random response generation: Randomly pick a response from the selected category’s dataset.  
   - Update the UI to display the generated response.  

5. **Responsiveness Testing**  
   - Test the app on different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).  
   - Ensure the layout and functionality work seamlessly across devices.  

6. **Quality Assurance**  
   - Test for bugs or inconsistencies in the user flow.  
   - Verify that the random responses are correctly mapped to the categories.  

7. **Deployment**  
   - Deploy the app to a web hosting platform (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages).  
   - Perform a final check to ensure everything is working as expected.  

---

#### **3. Technical Considerations**
1. **Framework/Library**:  
   - Use React, Vue.js, or plain HTML/CSS/JS based on team expertise.  

2. **Styling**:  
   - Use CSS or a CSS-in-JS solution for styling.  
   - Ensure the pixel font is loaded correctly and applied consistently.  

3. **Responsiveness**:  
   - Use CSS media queries or a responsive framework (e.g., Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS).  

4. **Randomization Logic**:  
   - Implement a simple randomization function (e.g., `Math.random()` in JavaScript) to pick responses.  

5. **Data Storage**:  
   - Store responses in a JSON file or as a JavaScript object.  

6. **Hosting**:  
   - Choose a reliable hosting platform that supports static websites.
